# Module_13_Challenge
## Overview:
### During this challenge we use our previously learned skills to create charts and a webpage to help users visulaize the data. In this case we are looking at the different bacteria's present in people's belly buttons. The webpage uses three differnt charts and graphs to show this. The first graph shows the top 10 bacteria found for each person. The second chart is the frequency of belly button washing. The third graph shows the amount of bacteria cultures per sample.
